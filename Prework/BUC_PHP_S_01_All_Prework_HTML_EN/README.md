#  HTML and CSS prework &ndash; exercises

## How do we do the exercises and submit our work?

Do the following steps:

1. [*Fork*](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository containing exercises.
2. Clone the repository onto your computer using the command: `git clone repository_address`.
You will find the address of the repository by pressing "Clone or download" button on its webpage.
3. Complete the exercises and commit changes to your repository using the commands below.
`git add filename` will add a single file which you have changed.
If you want to add all the changed files at once, use `git add .`.
Remember that the fullstop (dot) at the end of this command is important!
Next, commit changes using `git commit -m "description_of_changes"`.
4. Push changes to your repository on GitHub by typing: `git push origin master`.
5. Create a [*pull request*](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository when you have finished all the exercises.

## Important

Remember to make appropriate indentations in your code, no matter if it's HTML or CSS. Before you start doing the prework, read the article on [the principles of writing legible code](https://codepen.io/...............). We encourage you to study [formatting HTML code](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html/) as well.

**Exercises will be deleted two weeks after the end of the course. This will result in the removal of all forks made from this repository. If you wish to keep the access to the exercises, remember to make a copy of the repository onto your computer!**
